Is your campfire room not cluttered enough?  Use yellbot to annoy all your co-workers.

It'll need a listen token, which needs to be someone in the room, and a speaking token, which is whoever you want to say things.  It'll need a room id too, and it'll need to know your account.  Use the config file for that.

You can add replies in the reply! method.
